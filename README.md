# Layouts

I'm just tinkering here... I wanted to make a layout using grid, with a responsive drawer sidebar using the popover API.

Maybe there will be other things I try out here, and I'll try to document them here.

I'm building this with SvelteKit and some Tailwind. But other than that I want to minimise the amount of additional JS to make the layout functional.

## Developing

`pnpm install`, then start a development server:

```bash
pnpm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
pnpm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
pnpm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `pnpm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/adapters) for your target environment.
